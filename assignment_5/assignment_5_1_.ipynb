For example the 𝜙 -coefficient of the college student table has a negative value (Meaning low to no association), and the 𝜙 -coefficient for the 2 other tables have a positive value (Meaning there is some association here even if its not high). Also the odd ratio of the College student table is lesser than 1, in contrast to the other two tables were the values are greater than 1 (almost two for the table 2).  \n",
